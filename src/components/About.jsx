      <p>
        Hello! I'm Huu Khiem Nguyen, a passionate student at the University of Wollongong (UOW) 
        pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Information Technology (Dean's Scholar)</strong> 
        with a major in Website Design and Development. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am dedicated to creating engaging, accessible, and visually appealing web experiences. 
        With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I aim to blend creativity 
        with functionality to build solutions that make an impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of my studies, I enjoy exploring new technologies, experimenting with design ideas, 
        and honing my skills to stay at the forefront of web development. 
      </p>
